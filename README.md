# jgraphl - Java Graph Library

jgraphl is a Java class library for graph data structures and algorithms. It
heavily uses Java 8 features. Using it therefore requires JDK 1.8.

The design is influenced by these two Ruby and Java graph libraries:

* <https://github.com/monora/rgl>
* <https://github.com/jgrapht/jgrapht>

RGL is based on concepts from the C++
[Boost Graph Library](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_57_0/libs/graph/doc/),
which we also try to port to jgraphl.
